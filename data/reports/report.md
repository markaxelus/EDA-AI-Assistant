# Engineering Log Analysis Report

- Total clusters: **6**
- Feedback: [https://example.com/feedback](https://example.com/feedback)

## Cluster cluster_0 — signal '`<SIG>`' is not connected to any module ports.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `warning`

**Explanation**
This warning indicates that a declared signal (e.g., `wire` or `reg`) within a Verilog module is not connected to any input or output ports of instantiated sub-modules, nor is it an input or output port of the current module itself. It suggests the signal is declared but unused in the hierarchical connectivity of the design, potentially due to an oversight, a typo, or dead code.

**Suggested fixes**
- Remove the declaration of the signal if it is genuinely unused and not intended for any functional purpose within the design.
- Connect the signal to the intended input or output port of an instantiated sub-module by explicitly mapping it during instantiation (e.g., `sub_module_inst(.sub_port(local_signal))`).
- Add the signal to the port list of the current module if it is intended to be an input or output of this module for external connections.
- Correct any typos in the signal's name where it is declared or where it is intended to be used in port connections, ensuring consistent spelling.

## Cluster cluster_1 — syntax error near '`<SIG>`'
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
This error indicates that the `iverilog` parser encountered an unexpected token or an invalid structure immediately preceding the reported signal or keyword (e.g., "endmodule"). It commonly arises from missing delimiters like semicolons, unclosed block statements (e.g., `begin-end`, `if-else`, `case-endcase`), or incorrect syntax for declarations or assignments placed in an inappropriate context.

**Suggested fixes**
- Check the line *before* the reported token for missing semicolons, especially after module instantiations, assignments, or declarations.
- Verify that all `begin` blocks have a matching `end`, `case` statements have `endcase`, and multi-statement `if`/`else` blocks are correctly enclosed with `begin-end`.
- Ensure that declarations (e.g., `wire`, `reg`, `parameter`) and module instantiations are placed within the module scope and not inside procedural blocks, or that procedural assignments are within `always` or `initial` blocks.
- Look for unmatched parentheses, brackets, or braces in expressions or port lists, which can cause the parser to misinterpret subsequent code.

## Cluster cluster_2 — Unable to elaborate module '`<SIG>`'.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
This error signifies that the iverilog simulator was unable to locate or resolve the definition of the specified module during the elaboration phase, which is when the tool builds the design's hierarchical structure. This typically happens because the module's source file is missing, the module name is misspelled, or the file containing its definition is not accessible to the compiler.

**Suggested fixes**
- Ensure all source files (`.v`, `.sv`) defining the module and its dependencies are explicitly included in the `iverilog` command line.
- Verify that the module name specified as the top-level module (using `iverilog -s <module_name>`) or instantiated within your testbench exactly matches the `module <module_name>;` declaration in its source file.
- Use the `-I <directory>` option to specify additional search paths if your source files are located in different directories.

## Cluster cluster_3 — Executing Verilog-`<NUM>` frontend.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `info`

**Explanation**

**Suggested fixes**
- (none)

## Cluster cluster_4 — signal top.clk has no driver.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `warning`

**Explanation**
_(no summary)_

**Suggested fixes**
- (none)

## Cluster cluster_5 — Parser error in line `<NUM>`: syntax error, unexpected END.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
This error signifies that the Yosys parser encountered an unexpected end of a construct or the end of the input file itself, while still expecting to find more code within an open block. It typically indicates a missing closing keyword for a previously opened scope, such as an unclosed `module`, `begin...end`, `if...endif`, `case...endcase`, `function...endfunction`, or `task...endtask`.

**Suggested fixes**
- Check the code around the specified line number and before it for any missing closing keywords like `endmodule`, `end`, `endif`, `endcase`, `endfunction`, `endtask`, or `join`.
- Verify the hierarchical nesting of all code blocks, ensuring every `module`, `begin`, `if`, `case`, `function`, `task`, `fork`, or `generate` statement has its corresponding `endmodule`, `end`, `endif`, `endcase`, `endfunction`, `endtask`, `join`, or `endgenerate`.
- Inspect for any misplaced or premature `end` statements that might be closing a block too early, causing the parser to see an "unexpected END" later.
