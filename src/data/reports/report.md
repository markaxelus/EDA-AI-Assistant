# Engineering Log Analysis Report

- Total clusters: **6**
- Feedback: [https://example.com/feedback](https://example.com/feedback)

## Cluster cluster_0 — signal '<SIG>' is not connected to any module ports.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `warning`

**Explanation**
Unable to parse explanation from AI response

**Suggested fixes**
- **Establish intended connections (if the signal *should* be connected):**
- **Remove unused signal (if not intended for use):** If the signal was declared but is genuinely not used anywhere within the module, nor intended to be connected externally, simply remove its declaration. This often happens during refactoring, or if a signal was part of an earlier design iteration. Removing it cleans up the code and eliminates the warning.
- **Correct typos or logic errors in internal usage:** Sometimes the signal *is* meant to be used internally (e.g., as part of an `assign` statement or a procedural block), but a typo in its name prevents it from being correctly referenced. For instance, if you declare `logic clk;` but then accidentally use `clok` in an `always @(posedge clok)` block, `iverilog` will correctly flag `clk` as unused. Carefully review all instances where the signal is intended to be used (drivers and loads) and ensure consistent naming.

## Cluster cluster_5 — Parser error in line <NUM>: syntax error, unexpected END.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
Unable to parse explanation from AI response

**Suggested fixes**
- **Inspect `line <NUM>` and Preceding Lines for Missing Openers:** Go directly to the reported line number in your HDL file. The most common cause is a missing opening construct. Carefully check the lines *above* the error line for omitted keywords such as `module`, `function`, `task`, `always`, `initial`, `if`, `case`, `fork`, `begin`, or `generate`. Ensure every block that you intend to close with an `end` keyword has been properly opened.
- **Verify Block Pairing and Correct Closing Keywords:** Ensure all block-opening keywords have their correct corresponding closing keyword. For example:
- `module` must be closed by `endmodule`.
- `function` by `endfunction`.
- `task` by `endtask`.
- `always`, `initial`, `fork`, `begin` are closed by `end`.
- `case` by `endcase`.
- `if` in SystemVerilog often requires `endif`.
- **Check for Syntax Errors Immediately Before the `END`:** Although the error points to the `END` keyword, a syntax error on the line *just before* it could confuse the parser. For example, a missing semicolon, an unclosed parenthesis, or an incorrect declaration might cause the parser to misinterpret the structure of your code, leading it to believe a block is closed prematurely or that the `END` is out of place. Carefully review the syntax of the statement directly preceding `line <NUM>`.
