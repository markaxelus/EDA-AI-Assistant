# Engineering Log Analysis Report

- Total clusters: **6**
- Feedback: [https://example.com/feedback](https://example.com/feedback)

## Cluster cluster_0 — signal '`<SIG>`' is not connected to any module ports.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `warning`

**Explanation**
This warning indicates that a declared signal (wire or reg) within a Verilog module is not connected to any of the current module's ports, nor is it connected to any ports of sub-modules instantiated within it. This suggests the signal is either unused, misspelled in a connection, or part of an incomplete design.

**Suggested fixes**
- Remove the signal declaration if it is genuinely unused and not intended for future use, to clean up the code.
- Verify the signal name for typos in port connections to sub-modules or when connecting to the parent module's ports.
- Ensure the signal is properly driven or assigned a value, or correctly connected to a port of an instantiated sub-module or the current module's ports.

## Cluster cluster_1 — syntax error near '`<SIG>`'
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
This error signifies a violation of Verilog syntax rules, where the iverilog parser encountered the `endmodule` keyword at an unexpected location. This typically means the actual error is in the lines immediately preceding `endmodule`, such as an incomplete statement, an unclosed block, or a missing punctuation mark that causes `endmodule` to appear prematurely or out of context.

**Suggested fixes**
- Check for a missing semicolon (`;`) on the statement directly preceding `endmodule` or any other statement within the module.
- Ensure all block constructs like `begin...end`, `case...endcase`, `function...endfunction`, `task...endtask`, and `specify...endspecify` are correctly opened and closed.
- Verify that there are no unclosed parentheses `()` or square brackets `[]` within expressions, port lists, or array declarations.
- Review the code lines immediately before `endmodule` for typos, incorrect keywords, or illegal characters.

## Cluster cluster_2 — Unable to elaborate module '`<SIG>`'.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
This error indicates that iverilog could not find the definition of the specified module or resolve its hierarchy during the elaboration phase. This usually happens when the source file containing the module definition is not included in the compilation, or there's a mismatch in the module name.

**Suggested fixes**
- Ensure all Verilog source files that define the module and any sub-modules are included in the `iverilog` command.
- Verify the exact module name matches between its definition (`module <name> ... endmodule`) and its instantiation or top-level specification.
- Check for syntax errors within the module's definition or its instantiation that might prevent successful parsing.
- If using include directories (`-I` option), confirm the paths are correct and the module's definition file is located within one of them.

## Cluster cluster_3 — Executing Verilog-`<NUM>` frontend.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `info`

**Explanation**
_(no summary)_

**Suggested fixes**
- (none)

## Cluster cluster_4 — signal top.clk has no driver.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `warning`

**Explanation**
_(no summary)_

**Suggested fixes**
- (none)

## Cluster cluster_5 — Parser error in line `<NUM>`: syntax error, unexpected END.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
This Yosys parser error indicates that an opened Verilog/SystemVerilog construct (such as a module, always block, if statement, case statement, function, or task) was never properly closed with its corresponding `endmodule`, `end`, `endcase`, `endif`, etc., keyword, or there's an unmatched opening parenthesis/bracket, leading the parser to expect more code before reaching an unexpected end.

**Suggested fixes**
- Locate line 12 and preceding lines to identify any missing closing keywords like `endmodule`, `end`, `endcase`, `endif`, `endfunction`, or `endtask` for an opened block.
- Check for unbalanced parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, or curly braces `{}` which can confuse the parser about block boundaries.
- Review the code for typos in closing keywords (e.g., `emd` instead of `end`) or misplaced semicolons that could prevent the parser from recognizing block termination.
