# Engineering Log Analysis Report

- Total clusters: **6**
- Feedback: [https://example.com/feedback](https://example.com/feedback)

## Cluster cluster_0 — signal '<SIG>' is not connected to any module ports.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `warning`

**Explanation**
This warning indicates that a declared signal within a module does not serve as an input/output port for that module and is also not connected to any internal logic or sub-module ports, suggesting it is either redundant or a design oversight.

**Suggested fixes**
- If the signal is intended to be an external interface, add it to the module's port list (e.g., `input clk`, `output data`).
- If the signal is meant for internal logic, connect it to the relevant statements or instantiate a sub-module that uses it.
- If the signal is truly unneeded and serves no purpose, remove its declaration to eliminate the warning and clean up the code.

## Cluster cluster_1 — syntax error near '<SIG>'
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
The `iverilog` parser encountered the token "endmodule" at an unexpected point, indicating a syntax violation in the code preceding it. This typically means a statement or block was not properly terminated or completed, or a structural element like a `begin...end` block was left unclosed, causing the parser to interpret `endmodule` as an error.

**Suggested fixes**
- Examine the line immediately preceding `endmodule` for a missing semicolon (`;`).
- Verify that all `begin` statements have a corresponding `end` and all `case` statements have an `endcase` within the module.
- Check for any unclosed parentheses `()` or square brackets `[]` in signal declarations, instantiations, or assignments before `endmodule`.
- Ensure all module ports, parameters, and local declarations are correctly terminated and complete before the `endmodule` keyword.

## Cluster cluster_2 — Unable to elaborate module '<SIG>'.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `iverilog`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
The `iverilog` tool failed during the "elaboration" phase, which is when it attempts to build the hierarchical structure of your design by instantiating modules and resolving their connections. This error typically means the specified module (e.g., "counter_tb") could not be found or processed due to a missing source file, a typo, or critical syntax errors preventing its proper definition from being parsed.

**Suggested fixes**
- Ensure all Verilog source files defining the module and its submodules are included in the `iverilog` command line.
- Verify the module name (e.g., "counter_tb") in the error message exactly matches its definition (`module counter_tb(...)`) and any instantiation references, checking for typos.
- Inspect the source file for the problematic module for any syntax errors that might prevent `iverilog` from successfully parsing and defining it.
- If the module is intended as the top-level, ensure it is either the sole top-level module or explicitly specified using the `-s` option (e.g., `iverilog -s counter_tb -o sim.vvp counter_tb.v`).

## Cluster cluster_3 — Executing Verilog-<NUM> frontend.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `info`

**Explanation**

**Suggested fixes**
- (none)

## Cluster cluster_4 — signal top.clk has no driver.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `warning`

**Explanation**
_(no summary)_

**Suggested fixes**
- (none)

## Cluster cluster_5 — Parser error in line <NUM>: syntax error, unexpected END.
- Count: **1** | Tool: `yosys`
- Severity: `error`

**Explanation**
The Yosys parser encountered a closing keyword (e.g., `end`, `endmodule`, `endfunction`, `endcase`) at the specified line where it was not syntactically expected. This usually signifies an imbalance in block declarations, such as an extra closing keyword without a matching opening construct, or a preceding syntax error that has desynchronized the parser's state.

**Suggested fixes**
- Check the code at and immediately preceding line 12 for an extra closing keyword (e.g., `end`, `endmodule`, `endfunction`, `endtask`, `endcase`, `endif`) that lacks a corresponding opening construct.
- Verify that all `begin...end`, `case...endcase`, `if...else...endif`, `module...endmodule`, `function...endfunction`, and `task...endtask` blocks are correctly matched and properly nested.
- Review the lines leading up to line 12 for any earlier syntax errors, such as missing semicolons, incorrect port declarations, or unclosed statements, which might have confused the parser.
